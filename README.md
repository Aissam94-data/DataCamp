# Project Title:
ANALYSIS OF COVID-19 DATASET 
## Getting Started:
The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19 has now infected more than 2 million individuals and killed 120 thousand people around the world. The rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 continues and there is no drug or vaccine against the disease yet. While scientists are working to find the right solution, it is important to curtail the spread of this virus. Fortunately, in the last couple of months, we have been acquiring the needed skill to wrangle all kinds of data with python in the data insight program. Now is the time to put your skill to test!
In this analysis we focus on Algeria.
## Data:
Data is in CSV format and updated daily. It is sourced from [this upstream repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) maintained by the amazing team at [Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering](https://systems.jhu.edu/) (CSSE) who have been doing a great public service from an early point by collating data from around the world.

You can view the data, its structure as well as download it in alternative formats (e.g. JSON) from the DataHub:

This dataset includes time series data tracking the number of people affected by COVID-19 worldwide, including:
* confirmed tested cases of Coronavirus infection
* the number of people who have reportedly died while sick with Coronavirus
* the number of people who have reportedly recovered from it
